# Game Jam August 2017, 26th

## Presentation

I created this projet during a local Game Jam.

I chose to realize a new city-builder, as my Ludum Dare 39 project, with criticism of my developers friends on my first project.

This game, in development, is available on this this page : juliette-c.github.io/HitboxMaker_2017-08/

## Resources

I chose to use same graphics than my first project :

My friends help me to install tools of development and to improve my skills.
